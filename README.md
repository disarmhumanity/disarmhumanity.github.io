Currently seeking contributors to develop a website advocating the deweaponization of planet earth. Topics include the history of small arms and the development of advanced/automated weaponry, with a focus on their ongoing negative impact. Also, statistics and other proof of perpetual human irresponsibility with firearms. In addition, a catalog of resources containing links to related information and organizations.
